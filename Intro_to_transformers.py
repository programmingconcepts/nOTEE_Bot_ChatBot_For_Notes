Wi-Fi: ESP8266 module includes built-in WiFi capabilities, enabling projects to connect to the internet and communicate with other hardware or online services.
GPIO Pins: The NodeMCU board has many General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins that may be utilized for a variety of tasks, including digital input/output, analog input, and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) output.
Power: An easy way to upload your code to the NodeMCU board and connect with it through USB is to use the USB-to-serial converter, which is often included with the board.


The concentration of dissolved solids in a liquid is measured using an electrical device called a TDS sensor, sometimes referred to as a total dissolved solids sensor. It is often utilized in a variety of sectors and applications, including industrial operations, hydroponics, aquarium care, and checking the purity of water. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is the term used to describe the total amount of all inorganic and organic compounds that are suspended as molecular, ionized, or microgranular particles in a liquid. This comprises metals, cations, anions, salts, minerals, and occasionally even trace quantities of biological material.
